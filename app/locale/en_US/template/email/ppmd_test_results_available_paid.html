<p><b>Did you test positive?  Treatment available.</b></p>
<p>If you receive a positive result, we have many resources available.  Some STDs are curable with a simple antibiotic prescribed by our in-house physician network. If you test positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis, prescriptions are available to cure infection for $60 through your private, customer dashboard.  After picking up a prescription from your local pharmacy, most infections are cured within 7 to 10 days.  If you test negative, but are still experiencing symptoms, our physicians are available to discuss your situation over the phone and provide treatment if needed. If you test positive for herpes, medication is available to help control herpes outbreaks.  If positive for other STDs, our physicians are available to direct you to the best resources in your area based on your unique situation.</p>
