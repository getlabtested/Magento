<h5><span class="black-txt">Step 3:</span> Get Results</h5>
			Once your test results are ready, we will notify you to come back to the site and view your STD test results.<br />

After receiving your results, feel free to schedule an appointment to speak with our physician who can help interpret your results and, in many cases, can even prescribe treatment.  The cost of a doctor consultation is included in the cost of your test, but there will be an additional charge for prescribed treatment.<br />
