        <h3>What test is offered for Syphilis?</h3>
          <div>The technical name for the Syphilis test is the "Syphilis Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR)" test.  
          This is a blood test that detects that antibodies produced by an infected person’s body, that help 
          fight off the infection of Syphilis.  A positive test could indicate a current or previous infection, 
          as the antibodies stay in the body for years.  So, it is important to note that if you have had syphilis 
          in the past and were treated, your test results could still be returned as positive.</div>
        <h3>What kind of sample is required?</h3>
          <div>The “Syphilis Rapid Plasma Reagin Test” requires a blood sample which will be drawn by a medical 
          professional at local testing facility of your choosing.</div>

          <div>No advance preparation is required before your test - just be prepared to have your blood drawn 
          during the visit.</div>

          consultation with our physician, who can prescribe the appropriate treatment and medication for 
          Syphilis in case of infection. You never have to pay to call our on-call counselors or our in-house 
          physician. However, you may have to pay for the cost of medication.</div> 
        <h3>Are there treatment options for Syphilis infection?</h3>

        <h3>How often should I get tested for Syphilis?</h3>
          <div>There is a possibility that the blood test for Syphilis may not find antibodies for up to three 
          months after exposure to the bacteria. If you think you may have been exposed to syphilis, getting
