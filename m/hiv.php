        <h3>What test is offered for AIDS/HIV?</h3>
          <div>The actual test name for determining if HIV is present is called the “Eliza confirmed by Western 
          Blot test.” This blood test screens for the presence of HIV by determining if there are HIV antibodies 
          present in the system.  Most people infected with HIV / AIDS will show a positive test result within 
          3 months of exposure to HIV, using the screening test (repeating Elisa).  If the screening test proves 
          positive, that result is immediately confirmed with the Western Blot confirmation, which uses the same 
          blood sample (you will not be required to give another blood sample).  If you test for HIV before the 
          antibodies have had enough time to appear (this process is called Seroconversion), you may receive a 
          "false negative" result.  If you believe you may have returned a false negative result, we recommend 
          testing again within 6 months.</div> 
        <h3>What kind of sample is required?</h3>
          <div>This HIV Test requires a blood sample which will be drawn by a medical professional at local 
          testing facility of your choosing.</div>
        <h3>How to Prepare for Your Test?</h3>
          <div>No advance preparation is required before your test - just be prepared to have your blood drawn 
          during the visit.</div>
        <h3>When can I expect results?</h3>
          <div>HIV blood test results are usually available in 2-3 business days.  After you purchase your test 
          from us, you can choose to receive a phone call or email with your results.</div>
        <h3>Is there an at-home test kit for HIV / AIDS?</h3> 
          <div>We do not currently offer an at-home testing option for HIV as the test requires blood to be drawn 
          by a medical professional, ensuring maximum accuracy for test results.</div> 
        <h3>What if I have a positive result?</h3>
          <div>If you get tested and are returned a positive result, we are here to help.  Through our partnership 
          with the American Social Health Association (ASHA), we have certified expert STD counselors on-call 24 
          hours a day to help you interpret results and discuss any concerns you may have.  Additionally, we have 
          medical doctors available 24-7 (by appointment) that can answer any questions you may have.</div>
