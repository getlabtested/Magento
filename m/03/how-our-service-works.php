        <h2><span class="black-txt">2.</span> Call To Place Your Order</h2>
   		<p><strong>Call us at 866-839-0229</strong> to speak to an on-call STD Expert, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Our staff can help you understand which tests may be right for you, and will take your order.  All conversations and orders are kept 100% confidential.</p>
        <h2><span class="black-txt">3.</span> Get Tested</h2>
		<p>There is no need to make an appointment for your test â€“ just show up within normal business hours.  Our on-call experts will help you determine the wellness center most convenient to you.  If you choose an at-home testing option, your order will be mailed to you, and a sample will be sent back to our lab for analysis.</p>
        <h2><span class="black-txt">4.</span> Get Results</h2>
		<p>You can expect your test results within 3 days of your lab visit.  Although, in some cases, you can review results in as little as 48 hours.  You can choose to receive your test results either via email or phone.</p>
		<p>After receiving your results, feel free to schedule an appointment to speak with our physician who can help interpret your results and, in many cases, can even prescribe treatment.  The cost of a doctor consultation is included in the cost of your test, but there will be an additional charge for prescribed treatment.</p>
