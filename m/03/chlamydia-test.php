        <p>We offer 2 ways to test for Chlamydia: you can either test at a local wellness center or from the 
        privacy of your own home.  No matter which option you choose, we use the same physician-recommended test.</p>

        <h2>What test is offered for Chlamydia?</h2>
		<p>The actual test name for determining if Chlamydia is present is called the Chlamydia Nucleic Acid 
		Amplification (NAAT) Test.  This is a urine test that is based on amplification of the DNA that is 
		present in Chlamydia trachomatis. We also offer an at-home test package that will test you for both 
		Chlamydia and Gonorrhea at $15 less per test.</p>
        <h2>What kind of sample is required?</h2>
		<p>Our Chlamydia test requires a simple urine sample, given at either a local testing center or mailed 
		back to our lab (if you choose to order our at-home testing option).</p>  
        <h2>How to prepare for your test?</h2>
		<p>The only required preparation is to not urinate for at least one hour before giving your sample.</p>
        <h2>When can I expect results?</h2>
		<p>Chlamydia test results are usually available in 2-3 business days; however, results may take longer 
		to receive if you choose our at-home option. After you purchase your test from us, you can choose to 
		receive a phone call or email with your results.</p>
        <h2>What if I have a positive result?</h2>
		<p>If you get tested and are returned a positive result, we are here to help.  Through our partnership 
		with the American Social Health Association (ASHA), we have certified expert STD counselors on-call 24 
		hours a day to help you interpret results and discuss any concerns you may have.  Additionally, we have 
		medical doctors available 24-7 (by appointment) that can answer any questions you may have and, in most 
		cases, are even licensed to prescribe treatment.  It is important to note that a doctorâ€™s consultation 
		is included in the price of your test.</p>
