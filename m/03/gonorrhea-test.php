        <p>We offer 2 ways to test for Gonorrhea: you can either test at a local wellness center or from the 
        privacy of your own home.  No matter which option you choose, we use the same physician-recommended test.  
        We also offer an at-home test package that will test you for both Gonorrhea and Chlamydia - at $15 less 
        per test</p>

        <h2>What test is offered for Gonorrhea?</h2>
		<p>The actual test name for determining if Gonorrhea is present is called the Gonorrhea Nucleic Acid 
		Amplification (NAAT) Test.  This is a urine test that is based on amplification of the DNA that is 
		present in Gonorrhea infection.</p>
        <h2>What kind of sample is required?</h2>
		<p>Our Gonorrhea test requires a simple urine sample, given at either a local testing center or 
		mailed back to our lab (if you choose to test from the privacy of your own home).</p>
        <h2>How to prepare for your test?</h2>
		<p>The only required preparation is to not urinate for at least one hour before giving your sample.</p>
        <h2>When can I expect results?</h2>
		<p>Gonorrhea test results are usually available in 2-3 business days; however, results may take 
		longer to receive if you choose our at-home testing option. After you purchase your test from us, 
		you can choose to receive a phone call or email with your results.</p>
        <h2>What if I have a positive result?</h2>
		<p>If you get tested and are returned a positive result, we are here to help.  Through our 
		partnership with the American Social Health Association (ASHA), we have certified expert STD 
		counselors on-call 24 hours a day to help you interpret results and discuss any concerns you 
		may have.  Additionally, we have medical doctors available 24-7 (by appointment) that can answer 
		any questions you may have and, in most cases, are even licensed to prescribe treatment.  It is 
		important to note that a doctorâ€™s consultation is included in the price of your test.</p>
