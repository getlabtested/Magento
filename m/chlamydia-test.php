        <p>We offer 2 ways to test for Chlamydia: you can either test at a local wellness center or from the 
        privacy of your own home.  No matter which option you choose, we use the same physician-recommended test.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>What test is offered for Chlamydia?</h3>
          <div>The actual test name for determining if Chlamydia is present is called the Chlamydia Nucleic Acid 
          Amplification (NAAT) Test.  This is a urine test that is based on amplification of the DNA that is 
          present in Chlamydia trachomatis. We also offer an at-home test package that will test you for both 
          Chlamydia and Gonorrhea at $15 less per test.</div>
        <h3>What kind of sample is required?</h3>
          <div>Our Chlamydia test requires a simple urine sample, given at either a local testing center or mailed 
          back to our lab (if you choose to order our at-home testing option).</div>  
        <h3>How to prepare for your test?</h3>
          <div>The only required preparation is to not urinate for at least one hour before giving your sample.</div>
        <h3>When can I expect results?</h3>
          <div>Chlamydia test results are usually available in 2-3 business days; however, results may take longer 
          to receive if you choose our at-home option. After you purchase your test from us, you can choose to 
          receive a phone call or email with your results.</div>
        <h3>What if I have a positive result?</h3>
          <div>If you get tested and are returned a positive result, we are here to help.  Through our partnership 
          with the American Social Health Association (ASHA), we have certified expert STD counselors on-call 24 
          hours a day to help you interpret results and discuss any concerns you may have.  Additionally, we have 
          medical doctors available 24-7 (by appointment) that can answer any questions you may have and, in most 
          cases, are even licensed to prescribe treatment.  It is important to note that a doctorâ€™s consultation 
          is included in the price of your test.</div>
