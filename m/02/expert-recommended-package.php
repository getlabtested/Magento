        <p>Our Expert Recommended Test Package is based on national health guidelines and the recommendation of 
        our panel of STD experts.  This package includes tests for the most common STDs in the United States.  
        No appointment is necessary to test â€“ just show up to any of our over4,000 local wellness centers across 
        the country within normal business hours.</p>

        <h2>What tests are offered in the Expert Recommended Package?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Chlamydia Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAA)</li>

        <h2>What kind of sample is required?</h2>
		<p>Both Urine and Blood samples are required for our Expert Recommended test package, which can be 
		given at a local facility of your choosing.</p>
        <h2>Is there any preparation required?</h2>
		<p>To ensure the most accurate result, we ask that you do not urinate for at least 1 hour before 
		getting tested. There is no further preparation necessary for getting blood drawn.</p>
        <h2>When are results ready?</h2>
		<p>Test results are normally supplied in 2-3 business days (normally within 48 hours). Once results 
		are ready, you will be notified through email or a phone call (you choose the method of contact during 
		checkout).</p>
        <h2>What is included in the cost of the test?</h2>
		<p>Your purchase not only includes the actual testing for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HIV and Herpes 2 
		(genital herpes), but also includes a free post-results phone consultation with our physician, who 
		can prescribe the appropriate treatment and medication for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infection 
		(in some cases, Herpes 2 as well).  You never have to pay to call our on-call counselors or our 
		in-house physician.</p>
