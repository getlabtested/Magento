        <h2>What test is offered for Syphilis?</h2>
		<p>The technical name for the Syphilis test is the "Syphilis Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR)" test.  
		This is a blood test that detects that antibodies produced by an infected person’s body, that help 
		fight off the infection of Syphilis.  A positive test could indicate a current or previous infection, 
		as the antibodies stay in the body for years.  So, it is important to note that if you have had syphilis 
		in the past and were treated, your test results could still be returned as positive.</p>
        <h2>What kind of sample is required?</h2>
		<p>The “Syphilis Rapid Plasma Reagin Test” requires a blood sample which will be drawn by a medical 
		professional at local testing facility of your choosing.</p>
        <h2>How to Prepare for Your Test?</h2>
		<p>No advance preparation is required before your test - just be prepared to have your blood drawn 
		during the visit.</p>

		<p>Syphilis test results are usually available in 2-3 business days. After you purchase your test 
		from us, you can choose to receive a phone call or email with your results.</p>
        <h2>What is included in the cost of the test?</h2>
		<p>Your purchase not only includes the actual testing, but also includes a free post-results phone 
		consultation with our physician, who can prescribe the appropriate treatment and medication for 
		Syphilis in case of infection. You never have to pay to call our on-call counselors or our in-house 
		physician. However, you may have to pay for the cost of medication.</p> 
        <h2>Are there treatment options for Syphilis infection?</h2>
		<p>Yes, there is treatment available for Syphilis infection.  If you return a positive result, 
		our on-call physician will be able to prescribe treatment over the phone, which you can pick up at 
		the pharmacy of your choosing.  It is important to note that a doctor consultation is included in 
		the cost of your test package.</p>
        <h2>How often should I get tested for Syphilis?</h2>
		<p>There is a possibility that the blood test for Syphilis may not find antibodies for up to three 
		months after exposure to the bacteria. If you think you may have been exposed to syphilis, getting 
		another test within 6 months is recommended for your own peace of mind.</p>
