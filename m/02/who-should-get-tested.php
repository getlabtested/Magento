		<p>Some people who become infected with STDs will experience symptoms, which can differ based on the type of disease or infection.  Although each STD can have specific symptoms, many STDs (such as Chlamydia and Gonorrhea) often show no signs or symptoms of infection and, if left untreated, can cause serious and permanent health problems.  The only way to be completely sure of your sexual health is to be tested.  And, in the chance you test positive for an STD, we offer real help.  Through our partnership with the American Social Health Association, we offer on-call counselors available 24 hours a day, who can discuss your results, evaluate symptoms, and even set up an appointment with our physician – who can, in many cases, prescribe treatment over the phone.</p>
		<p>If you’re unsure of what to be tested for, you can always speak to one of our on-call STD counselors, free of charge, at <strong>866-236-5343</strong>.</p>
