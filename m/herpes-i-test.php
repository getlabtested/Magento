        <h3>What test is offered for Oral Herpes?</h3>
          <div>The actual test name for determining if Herpes 1 (Oral Herpes) is present is called the 
          Type 1 IgG (HerpeSelect™) Test.  This specific test is the one recommended by the Center for 
          Disease Control (CDC) and looks for the antibodies that are specific to the Herpes Simplex 1 
          Virus (HSV-1).</div>
        <h3>What kind of sample is required?</h3>
          <div>This HSV-1 (Oral Herpes) Test requires a blood sample which will be drawn by a medical 
          professional at local testing facility of your choosing.</div>
        <h3>How to Prepare for Your Test?</h3>
          <div>No advance preparation is required before your test - just be prepared to have your blood 
          drawn during the visit.</div>
        <h3>When can I expect results?</h3>
          <div>HerpeSelect™ herpes blood test results are usually available in 2-3 business days.  After 
          you purchase your test from us, you can choose to receive a phone call or email with your results.</div>
        <h3>Is there an at-home test kit for Herpes 1?</h3> 
          <div>We do not currently offer an at-home testing option for Herpes 1 as the test requires blood 
          to be drawn by a medical professional, ensuring maximum accuracy for test results.</div> 
        <h3>What if I have a positive result?</h3>
          <div>If you get tested and are returned a positive result, we are here to help.  Through our 
          partnership with the American Social Health Association (ASHA), we have certified expert STD 
          counselors on-call 24 hours a day to help you interpret results and discuss any concerns you 
          may have.  Additionally, we have medical doctors available 24-7 (by appointment) that can answer 
          any questions you may have.</div>
