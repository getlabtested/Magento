	<h1>Common Questions</h1>
	<h3>Can I really get tested today?</h3>
	<p>Yes! After you choose your online STD tests, you will pick a local STD testing center convenient to you - you will NOT need to make an appointment to get tested. Just print out your Lab Order Requisition form supplied after you check out (it will be sent via email), and bring it to your chosen local STD testing center during their normal business hours. If you order tests after the local STD center has closed, you can get STD tested at any time the following business day.</p>
	<h3>How soon will I get my results?</h3>
	<p>You can expect your test results within&nbsp;5 business days of your lab visit. Although, <strong>in some cases, you can receive your STD test results within as little as 24&ndash;48 hours.</strong> Please note that the test you order, as well as the local STD testing center you choose, can be factors in the amount of time it takes to receive your results and the general expectation is to receive your results in 5 business days. Our at-home tests take longer as we ship your at-home test kit to you, and you in turn ship your sample back to our lab for testing.</p>

	<h3>How accurate is the STD test? Is there any chance my results could be wrong?</h3>
	<p>We use the same STD tests that you would receive at a hospital &ndash; so be assured you are testing with the most accurate tests available.</p>
	<h3>What if I get a positive result?</h3>
	<p>If you get STD tested and receive a positive result, we are here to help. Through our partnership with the American Social Health Association (ASHA), we have certified expert STD counselors available to help you interpret results and discuss any concerns you may have. Additionally, we have medical doctors available that can answer any questions you may have and, in most cases, are even licensed to prescribe treatment. It is important to note that a doctor&rsquo;s consultation is included in the price of your test, but there will be an additional charge if you would like our physician to prescribe treatment. So give us a call today at 877-647-9251 to discuss any concerns you may have.</p>
	<h3>Are my results 100% confidential?</h3>
	<p>Yes, your sexual health is a private matter and we treat it as such with 100% confidentiality. We will never share any of your information, including your STD test results, other than when a positive result is required by law to be provided to the State Health Department for statistical purposes.</p>
	<h3>Can I use my health insurance to pay for my test?</h3>
	<p>We can not accept health insurance as an immediate form of payment. However, your STD Test order will be approved by a physician &ndash; meaning it can be submitted to most insurance agencies for reimbursement. To find out your exact level of reimbursement, please contact your health insurance provider. To order tests, purchases will need to be made via Credit Card or prepaid Credit Card. You can also use your Health Savings Account (HSA) Credit Card if you have one.</p>
